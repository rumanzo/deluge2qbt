 - Save date, metrics, status. **
 - Import of tags and labels
 - Multithreading

> [!NOTE]
> \* This torrents will not be done (0%) and will need force rehash

> [!NOTE]
>\*\* The calculation of the completed parts is based only on the priority of the files in torrent

> [!NOTE]
>\*\*\* Partially downloaded torrents will be visible as 100% completed, but in fact you will need to do a rehash. Without rehash torrents not will be valid. This is due to the fact that conversion of .dat files in which parts of objects are stored is not implemented.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget before use make backup bittorrent\utorrent, qbittorrent folder. and config %APPDATA%/Roaming/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.ini. Close all this program before.
